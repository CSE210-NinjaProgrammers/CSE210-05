# Cycle game
The best rides are the ones where you
bite off much more than you can chew,
and live through it.

- Doug Bradbury -

Cycle is a game where players have to run away from their opponent using cycles, the challenge is that cycles leave a trail behind the player. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
